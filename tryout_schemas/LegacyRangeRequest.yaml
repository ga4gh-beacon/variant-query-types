title: VariantRangeRequest
description: >-
  A request for matching variants in a genomic range. This request type requires
  to provide *exactly* 1 `start` and 1 `end` position, which are both 0-based and
  define the base range with which variants should be associated. The exact way
  of variant association (e.g. complete or partial overlap or even proximity) is 
  being left to the individual implementations and use cases.
  Beacon version: v2.0
  Future considerations: There are some inherited ambiguities
  * `assemblyId` and `referenceName` should be deprectated in favour of a versioned
    `sequenceId`
  * the shared use of the `start` and `end` parameters for both base positions and
    bracket positions is not ideal - here addressed by the `sequencePosition` type
    but still existing in parameters
