title: BeaconAlleleRequest
description: |-
  `BeaconAlleleRequest` represents the "classic" Beacon request type where
  a genomic sequence variation is queried by position and sequence (as well as
  optional reference sequence).
  Beacon version: v1.0
  Future considerations: There are some inherited ambiguities
  * `assemblyId` and `referenceName` should be deprectated in favour of a versioned
    `sequenceId`
  * in alignment with VRS future versions should abandon the concept of a reference
    sequence
  * the use of `variantType` is not allowed (or should be ignored) when providing
    an explicit sequence
