title: VariantBracketRequest
description: |-
  A request for matching variants by position, with start and end positions falling
  into specified genomic ranges. The typical use case here is the query for similar
  structural variations - particularly CNVs - affecting a genomic region but potentially
  differing in their exact base extents.
  Beacon version: v2.0
  Future considerations: There are some inherited ambiguities
  * `assemblyId` and `referenceName` should be deprectated in favour of a versioned
    `sequenceId`
  * the shared use of the `start` and `end` parameters for both base positions and
    bracket positions is not ideal - here addressed by the `sequenceBracket` type
    but still existing in parameters

      An array of exactly 2 sorted integers for base positions bracketing the
      genomic range in which the start of the matched variants has to fall. For
      base exact matches this woyld mean `start[1] = start[0] + 1`.
