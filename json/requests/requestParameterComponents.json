            "description": "The `variantType` is used to query variants which are not defined through a sequence of one or more bases using the `alternateBases` parameter. This VCF derived parameter is being replaced by the more specific VRS derived parameters such as `copyChange`. (Legacy) Examples here are e.g. structural variants: * DUP\n  - increased allelic count of material from the genomic region between\n    `start` and `end` positions\n  - no assumption about the placement of the additional sequences is being\n    made (i.e. no _in situ_ requirement as tandem duplications)\n* DEL: deletion of sequence following `start`\nIn contrast to the updated VRS based v2.n parameters such as `copyChange` the Beacon v1.1 -> v2.1 query model is not prescriptive with regard to the values allowed for `variantType` with use of extended types (e.g. `EFO:0030063`) being permitted. However, a support for the basic CNV types above - where represented in the data - is recommended. Status: LEGACY with potential use in v2.n for non-CNV parameters  Note: The VRS v2 `copyChange` is now a partial and more specific replacement\n      over `variantType` for copy number variations. However, additional\n      concepts so far have not been covered and might warrant use of an\n      additional parameter (`variantClass`?).",
