This request does not provide coordinates so on the server side matching\nhas to be performed from annotated variants or by retrieving the gene's\ncoordinates and creating internally a type of range request. Here we're also \nlimiting the size of the CNV to a typical \"focal deletion\" with a lower minimum\nsize of 1kb (to avoid noise and non-structural variants) and an upper limit\nof 3Mb (to avoid large chromosomal deletions).",
