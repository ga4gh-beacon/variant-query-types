This request does not provide coordinates so on the server side matching has to be performed from annotated variants or by retrieving the gene's coordinates and creating internally a type of range request. Here we're also  limiting the size of the CNV to a typical \"focal deletion\" with a lower minimum size of 1kb (to avoid noise and non-structural variants) and an upper limit of 3Mb (to avoid large chromosomal deletions).",
