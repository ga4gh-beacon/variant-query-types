The deletion to be found are expected to have an overlap with the queried range; however, the extent of the overlap is not pre-defined (most endpoints woul respond to a **recommended** \"any\" overlap but this is not a strict requirement imposed by the schema). Here positions refer to chromosome 17 on GRCh38 as indicated by the referenceName RefSeq ID.\n*Recommendation* Implementers should provide a mechanism to match any \"deletion\" `variantType` (`EFO:0030067`, `DEL`, `SO:0001743`) independent of size since operational definitions of `CNV` vs. `INDEL` vary, and use explicit `variantMinLength`, `variantMaxLength` parameters if needed.",
