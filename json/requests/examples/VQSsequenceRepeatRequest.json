In individuals without Huntington's disease, this CAG segment is typically repeated 10 to 35 times. Expansions beyond 35 copys are associated with the development of Huntington's disease.\nExamples for query parameters are:\n* GeneId: HTT * referenceAccession: refseq:NC_000004.12 * start: 3074681 * end: 3243960 * RepeatSubunitLength: 3 (CAG) * RepeatSubunitCount: [36, 250] (not yet defined in VRS or Beacon) * SequenceLength:  [105, 750]\nSee also the [genome browser material](https://genome.ucsc.edu/training/education/cag.html).\n#### Solution using `VQSsequenceRepeatRequest` with locus and `sequenceLength`\nThis example uses the HTT genome position and a range of (extended) sequence lengths to match against a `ReferenceLengthExpression` since the VRS v2 model does not contain a \"repeat count\" concept but only the overall length and unit length (as well as the sequence).\nTODO: Limit location to first exon?",
