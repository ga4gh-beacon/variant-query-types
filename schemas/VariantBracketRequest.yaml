title: VariantBracketRequest
description: >-
  A request for matching variants by position, with start and end positions falling
  into specified genomic ranges. The typical use case here is the query for similar
  structural variations - particularly CNVs - affecting a genomic region but potentially
  differing in their exact base extents.

      An array of exact 2 sorted integers for base positions bracketing the
      genomic range in which the start of the matched variants has to fall. For
      base exact matches this woyld mean `start[1] = start[0] + 1`.
