          The `logical` identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a
          UUID. This `id` is unique within a given system. The identified entity
          may have a different `id` in a different system, or may refer to an
          `id` for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).

          A free-text description of the entity.

      sequence:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A character string of _residues_ that represents a biological sequence
          using the conventional sequence order (5’-to-3’ for nucleic acid
          sequences, and amino-to-carboxyl for amino acid sequences). IUPAC
          ambiguity codes are permitted in Sequence Strings.
          TODO: Needed for Beacon? Revise definition - in VRS a referenced schema.
