      ### Find  t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocations

      #### Solution for `VQSrequest` using genomic ranges (`VQSadjacencyRequest`)

      This is a query for translocations between the MYC and IgH loci, where the
      breakpoints are loosely defined through there well known cytogenetic bands.
      The query here follows the VRS adjacency model. In contrast to the VRS
      representational model, here:    


      - VRS uses an array of 2 genomic locations while Beacon names the location
        parameters individually (using "adjacency..." for the second partner)    
      - VRS explicitely encodes directionality by using either `start` or `end`
        position parameters (integers or ranges) while this query example creates
        non-directional ranges on both sides since directionality might not be known,
        the storage system might not encode this or all options could be of interest
