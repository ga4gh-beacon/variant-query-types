      ### Copy number gains involving the _whole_ locus _chr2:54,700,000-63,900,000_

      #### Solution for `VQSrequest` using `start` and `end` ranges (`VQScopyCountRequest`)

      The query has to indicate the involved genomic region by positions as well as the
      type of change. Here, matched duplication events start 5\` of the region and end 3\`
      of it. For capturing any event upt to the complete chromosome duplication this
      requires knowledge about the maximum value (_i.e._ chromosome base length; using a
      random very large number might fail depending on the implementation).

      The example uses `"copyCount": [2,4]` for low level copy number gains on a
      diploid genotype (_i.e._ more than 2, up to 4 copies).
