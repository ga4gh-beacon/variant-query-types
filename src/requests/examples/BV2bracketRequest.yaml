      ### Find small, _variable_ sequence insertions/deletions at an approximate position
      
      #### Solution `g_variant` with `start` and `end` ranges (`BV2bracketRequest`)
      and `variantType`

      Here sequence variants (insertions or deletions) involving a specific region
      on chromosome 17 but of varying length are matched by using "fuzzy" start 
      and end ranges ("brackets"). The variant type is identified as an INDEL although
      the interpretation is left to the implementation; e.g. an insertion which is
      stored as sequence change `17:43045708:A>AAACAAAC` would fulfill the request
      but might not be indicated as `INDEL` type.

      ### Copy number gains involving the _whole_ locus _chr2:54,700,000-63,900,000_

      #### Solution for `g_variant` using `start` and `end` ranges (`BV2bracketRequest`)

      The query has to indicate the involved genomic region by positions as well as the
      type of change. Here, matched duplication events start 5\` of the region and end 3\`
      of it. For capturing any event upt to the complete chromosome duplication this
      requires knowledge about the maximum value (_i.e._ chromosome base length; using a
      random very large number might fail depending on the implementation).

      The example uses `EFO:0030070` for `copy number gain` instead of the alternative
      `SO:0001742` `copy_number_gain` or the VCF `DUP` as the preferred since the EFO terms
      provide a more granular expressivity and are referenced in the
      [VRS definitions](https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/latest/terms_and_model.html#systemic-variation).
