      ### Query for a focal deletion involving TP53
      
      #### Solution using `VQSgeneIdRequest` with `geneId`

      Query for a deletion involving TP53 by using the HUGO name to specify the
      gene. This request does not provide coordinates so on the server side matching
      has to be performed from annotated variants or by retrieving the gene's
      coordinates and creating internally a type of range request. Here we're also 
      limiting the size of the CNV to a typical "focal deletion" with a lower minimum
      size of 1kb (to avoid noise and non-structural variants) and an upper limit
      of 3Mb (to avoid large chromosomal deletions).

    request:
      requestType: VQSgeneIdRequest
      geneId: TP53
      copyChange: EFO:0030067
      sequenceLength:
        - 1000
        - 3000000
      vrsType: CopyNumberCount
