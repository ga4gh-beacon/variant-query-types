# Genomic Variation Types

The specific meaning of variation terms varies between different terminologies, file
standards and biomedical domains. Here we address such ambiguities through the documentation
of overarching concepts (e.g. "genomic deletions") and the different flavours of their
manifestations.

!!! info "Under Construction"

	This page is currently under construction and will be updated with the types
	of variants supported in teh different Beacon flavours.

	Currently (February 2025, towards GA4GH Connect 2025) there is rapid development
	which is reflected in the version specific pages:

	- [Beacon v2 Query Solutions](../generated/requestProfiles_g_variant) for demonstrating options provided by Beacon v2
	- [Beacon v2+ Query Proposals](../generated/requestProfiles_VQSrequest) for proposed parameters and solutions in a Beacon v2+ "Variant Query Standard" **VQS**


	For additional background see the previous [Beacon Scouts: Genomic Variants Use Cases & Examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwwRQ2PtlN1dBffCugdkbSHWCPmLgLkADd-5mu-rVAw/edit).

<!-- !!! bug "Beacon Scouts To Do"

	We will add and document the variation concepts during the 2024/25 Beacon Variation
	Scouts process.
