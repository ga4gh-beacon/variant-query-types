# Genomic Variation Types

The specific meaning of variation terms varies between different terminologies, file
standards and biomedical domains. Here we address such ambiguities through the documentation
of overarching concepts (e.g. "genomic deletions") and the different flavours of their
manifestations.

!!! info "Under Construction"

	For a start please see the previous [Beacon Scouts: Genomic Variants Use Cases & Examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwwRQ2PtlN1dBffCugdkbSHWCPmLgLkADd-5mu-rVAw/edit).

!!! bug "Beacon Scouts To Do"

	We will add and document the variation concepts during the 2024 Beacon Variation
	Scouts process.
