# Recommended Ternminologies and Example Values

Beyond single beacons or managed beacon networks the use of common, widely supported and standardized query values is of special importance to empower federated queries.
The main examples relevant to variation queries here are `referenceName` and
`variantType`. 

!!! info "Value Definitions in the Beacon Schemas"

	In most of its schemas the Beacon v2 specification is not prescriptive in the
	specific values permitted for individual parameters and provides a number of
	legacy values as examples in its inline documentation. This was thought
	to promote flexibility (e.g. non-human use cases) and simple adoption (e.g. reusing
	VCF terms).

!!! bug "Beacon Scouts To Do"

	We will add and document recommended termionologies and use case examples during
	the _2024 Beacon Variation Scouts_ process.
