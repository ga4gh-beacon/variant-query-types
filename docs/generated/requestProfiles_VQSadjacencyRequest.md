# Request Pattern: `VQSadjacencyRequest`

A typical Beacon v2.n request for sequence adjacency queries, e.g. for the retrieval of chromosomal translocation events or sequence fusions. TODO: In VRS v2 there is an implicit sequence directionality from the use of either start or end parameters for either side of the adjacency. This might be problematic on the query side where in many instances just the approximate position of the (fused) breakpoints maight be of interest. This needs additional clarification (e.g. use of integer `start` and `end`, `adjacencyStart` and  `adjecencyEnd` parameters to indicate direction independent matching).
