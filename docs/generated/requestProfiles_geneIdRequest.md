# Request Profile: `geneIdRequest`

A typical Beacon v2.n request for gene queries, e.g. for the retrieval of
all variants in a gene or variants restricted by additional parameters
such `variantType` or length of the affected sequence.
TODO: Evaluate to split into more basic `GeneIdRequest` and specialized
      requests requiring an effect component.
