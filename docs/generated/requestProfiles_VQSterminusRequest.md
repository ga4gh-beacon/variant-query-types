# Request Profile: `VQSterminusRequest`

A Beacon v2.n request for a sequence terminus, _i.e._ the end of a sequence.
An example would be the match of chromosomal breakpoints terminating the
derived chromosome w/o resulting sequence fusion.

TODO: As in adjacency requests one could use `startRange` or `endRange`
to limit the side of the breakpoint.
